<h2>Brief introduction to Markdown (covers the github flavored markdown)</h2>

<p>Markdown is a way to write readable html text where the markup is discreet. Markdown documents can be read by themselves without having been into html.</p>

<p>This affords me 2 wins, (a) I have ready html files that can go on the web if needed and (b) for the standard text files, i get a structure for those as well.</p>

<pre><code># Headings are done like this, i.e. pre-pended by a #

# heading1
## heading2
### heading3
#### heading4
##### heading5
###### heading6
</code></pre>

<pre><code>H1 headings can also be done by underling with a =
==================================================

H2 headings with a -

<h1>heading1</h1>

<h2>heading2</h2>

<h3>heading3</h3>

<h4>heading4</h4>

<h5>heading5</h5>

<h6>heading6</h6>

<p>Blockquotes are used to represent a multiline block of text, and are represented by prepending a line with a >

<h2>Lists</h2>

<p>Lists are important and work as expected. Numbered lists are written like this</p>

<ol>
<li>One</li>
<li>Two</li>
<li>Three</li>
</ol>


<p>Bullets like this -</p>

<ul>
<li>this is a point</li>
<li>this is another</li>
<li>an another</li>
</ul>


<p>Or like this -</p>

<ul>
<li>this is a point</li>
<li>this is another</li>
<li>an another</li>
</ul>


<p>(I couldnt get nested lists to work, maybe should try with some other markdown processor)</p>
