## Brief introduction to Markdown (covers the github flavored markdown)

Markdown is a way to write readable html text where the markup is discreet. Markdown documents can be read by themselves without having been into html. 

This affords me 2 wins, (a) I have ready html files that can go on the web if needed and (b) for the standard text files, i get a structure for those as well.

```
# Headings are done like this, i.e. pre-pended by a #

# heading1
## heading2
### heading3
#### heading4
##### heading5
###### heading6
```

```
H1 headings can also be done by underling with a =
==================================================

H2 headings with a -
-----------------------
```

# heading1

## heading2

### heading3

#### heading4

##### heading5

###### heading6

Blockquotes are used to represent a multiline block of text, and are represented by prepending a line with a >
```
>Usually used in a section quoted from another source.

##Lists
Lists are important and work as expected. Numbered lists are written like this

1. One
2. Two 
3. Three

Bullets like this - 

* this is a point
* this is another
* an another

Or like this - 

- this is a point
- this is another
- an another

(I couldnt get nested lists to work, maybe should try with some other markdown processor)
